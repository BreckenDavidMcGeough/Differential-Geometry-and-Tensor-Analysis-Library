# Differential Geometry and Tensor Analysis Library
## A library for use in differential geometry calculations

This library can be used for calculations involved with Einsteins' Field Equations, starting with a metric in the form of a differential ine element, and calculating the non-zero connection coefficients, the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor, Ricci scalar, and can be used to solve for the set of second order coupled differential equations given by the geodesic equation for a spacetime metric.
